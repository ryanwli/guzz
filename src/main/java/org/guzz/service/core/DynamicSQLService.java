 * In guzz, complicated sqls are suggested to be stored in the guzz.xml file like IBatis.
 * The advantage is good for management, but once you have to change it, you must restart your apps to take effects.
 * That is a big issue for any really serious online systems.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To solve this problem, guzz introduced {@link DynamicSQLService}, with which you can add/remove/update(tune) complicated and/or
 * performance critica sqls online without restarting; you can also design some new architectures to retrieve data for (ajax based) show out without writing a single line of server-side code.
